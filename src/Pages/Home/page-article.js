              <p>
                FastLoanAdvance services will always be provided free of charge,
                but that is not to say that the lender will give you a loan for
                free. Your lender will charge you fees and/or interest and must
                provide you with full disclosure of their loan terms upon
                approval. It is then your responsibility to read through the
                terms before signing your loan agreement.

              <p>
                Late Payment penalties differ from lender to lender. Lenders may
                be forgiving if you contact them directly, though some may
                automatically add a fee if it is in their agreement. For more
                information, please contact the lender directly if you have any
                issues repaying your loan.

              <p>
                Loan repayment terms differ by lender. Thus, it is important to
                check the loan agreement from your lender for information on the

              <h5>APR INFORMATION</h5>
              <p>
                Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost of credit,
                expressed as a nominal yearly rate. It relates to the amount and
                timing of value received by the consumer to the amount and
                timing of payments made. FastLoanAdvance cannot guarantee any
                APR since we are not a lender ourselves. An APR can generally
                run between 5.99% up to 35.99%. Loan products general have a
                61-day minimum repayment term and a 72-month maximum repayment
                term. Before accepting a loan from a lender within our network,
                please read the loan agreement carefully as the APR and
                repayment terms may differ from what is listed on this site.
